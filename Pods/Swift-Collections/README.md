More Collections for Swift
=============

More Collections for Swift introduces a few useful native collection types not currently in Swift. These collections are designed to coexist with the Swift framework.

This library's API follow Swift's Array and Dictionary API closely.  It is also influenced by Apple's Foundation Framework and [Google's Guava collections](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained).  More Collections for Swift are designed to be as simple as possible while still satisfying a majority of each collectionâ€™s use cases.

## Collections

### Set
A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  This is not an ordered set, deterministic iteration is not guaranteed.  As such it cannot be indexed via the index operator.

### Stack
A first in last out data structure.

### Tree
A collection that models linked nodes in a hierarchical tree structure.  A tree contains a root value and 0 or more children trees.

### Multimap
A collection that maps keys to values, similar to Map, but in which each a key may be associated with multiple values.  

## Version

0.1 Alpha.  The API is subject to change.   

## Collaborate

All development happens on GitHub.  File an issue or pull request for new features and fixes.  

If any of these collections exist already in Swift's standard library let me know and I will delete the duplicate classes found here.  Suggestions for improvements are welcome!
